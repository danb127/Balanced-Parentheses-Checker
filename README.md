### 🎓 The Quest
In the vast universe of Computer Science and Engineering, I've embarked on a quest to conquer the realms of data structures and algorithms at Western Michigan University. As a part of this journey, I've developed the Balanced Parentheses Checker, a beacon of logic and order in the chaotic world of strings and characters.

### 🛠️ The Arsenal
- **Language of the Elders:** Crafted with [Your Programming Language], invoking the ancient runes of computer science.
- **Artifacts of Logic:** Employs mystical data structures known as Stacks and Queues, conjured through the arcane art of linked lists.

### 🌟 Features
- **Dual Wield Functionality:** Whether you prefer the swift Stack or the enduring Queue, choose your weapon to battle unbalanced parentheses.
- **Custom Forged Data Structures:** Forged in the depths of [Your Programming Language], these structures are a testament to the craftsmanship of coding without reliance on built-in magic.
