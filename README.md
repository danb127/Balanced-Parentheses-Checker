### 🎓 Overview
This project is a deep dive into data structures and algorithms, developed as part of my academic journey at Western Michigan University. The Balanced Parentheses Checker is a tool designed to check for balanced parentheses in strings, showcasing the application of stacks and queues through custom-implemented linked lists.

### 🛠️ Features
- **Dual Checking Methods:** Choose between Stack or Queue implementations to verify string balance.
- **Custom Data Structures:** Built from scratch in [Your Programming Language], emphasizing an understanding of underlying mechanisms.

### 🔍 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/danb127/balanced-parentheses-checker.git

ruby
Copy code
2. Setup Instructions:
- **For Python:**
  - Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
  - Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies (if any):
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
  - Run the project:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
- **For Java:**
  - Make sure Java JDK is installed and set up on your machine.
  - Compile the Java files from the project directory:
    ```
    javac ClassName.java
    ```
  - Run the compiled class file:
    ```
    java ClassName
    ```
- **For C++:**
  - Verify C++ compiler (g++, clang++, etc.) is installed on your system.
  - Compile the C++ source file:
    ```
    g++ -o parenthesesChecker main.cpp
    ```
  - Execute the compiled program:
    ```
    ./parenthesesChecker
    ```

Replace `ClassName` with the actua

### 📜 Background
The Balanced Parentheses Checker was inspired by a challenge faced in computer science: ensuring that a series of parentheses are properly closed and nested. This project was an opportunity to tackle that challenge head-on, applying practical data structure concepts.

### 🌱 What's Next
- **Exploring More Data Structures:** Looking to delve into more complex data structures for future challenges.
- **Debugging and Optimization:** Continuous improvement of the codebase for better performance and reliability.
