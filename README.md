### 🎓 Overview
This project is a deep dive into data structures and algorithms, developed as part of my academic journey at Western Michigan University. The Balanced Parentheses Checker is a tool designed to check for balanced parentheses in strings, showcasing the application of stacks and queues through custom-implemented linked lists.

### 🛠️ Features
- **Dual Checking Methods:** Choose between Stack or Queue implementations to verify string balance.
- **Custom Data Structures:** Built from scratch in [Your Programming Language], emphasizing an understanding of underlying mechanisms.

### 🔍 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/danb127/balanced-parentheses-checker.git
2. [Add setup instructions specific to your project here.]
3. To run the checker:
[Your command to run the project]
Follow the prompts in the console to test your strings.

### 📜 Background
The Balanced Parentheses Checker was inspired by a challenge faced in computer science: ensuring that a series of parentheses are properly closed and nested. This project was an opportunity to tackle that challenge head-on, applying practical data structure concepts.

### 🌱 What's Next
- **Exploring More Data Structures:** Looking to delve into more complex data structures for future challenges.
- **Debugging and Optimization:** Continuous improvement of the codebase for better performance and reliability.
